below.

As we can see in the graph below, the seasons with the highest ratings
and the biggest viewership were the first 6. We could also observe that
the more people watch the higher the rating was.

The increasing number of each episode has been recorded as EpisodeID. In
the diagram that follows we can observe that the larger the number of
episodes the less viewership it had. Look at the pink points are the top
8 EpisodeID by viewership. Seems like the most viewed episodes was the
early ones. The outlier point is the episode [‚ÄúStress
Relief‚Äù](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248736/) at season 5, with rating
9.7.

I categorized the episodes based on their duration into double or single
depending on whether the duration exceeds 30 minutes. Notice that the
double episodes have higher scores than the singles in every season.

There is not a strong pattern about the day of the month an episode was
released.  
![](the-office-episodes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

Contrariwise most episodes was released on Thursdays. That one episode
was the [‚ÄúStress Relief‚Äù](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248736/) episode
which had the highest rating and the biggest viewership averall.
